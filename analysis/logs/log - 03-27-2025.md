### Date:
Week 23-29 March

log date 03/27/2025


### Number of hours:

## week 24-30

- 4 hours of the week for the linkdln,Resume editing,completeing the videos on d2l and developing professional skills
- 2 hours of week to excat the data from websites for analysis
- 10 hours for analysis of the data extracted from the websites
- 5-8 hours for coding - to extract the required info from the data extracted to prepare for Network anlysis
- 1-2 hours for proposal to submit on 4th April


### Rose:
This week, I had my first project meeting with Dr. Sarah Bratt and Dr. Cristian Roman(first call on 03/10 was an introdcution of myself to professor and intro to project) ), where I got a better understanding of our research goals and the overall approach.

I also started exploring different websites and sources to find article citations of software used in scientific research. Since we just started on the 24th, I’ve been backing up a lot of project data and learning new ways to export it efficiently.

### Bud:
I want to explore what influences software adoption in scientific research, especially in evolutionary biology.

I plan to analyze software mentions and see how factors like geography, language, and collaboration networks shape usage. Understanding these patterns will help me apply network analysis more effectively and think about its use in other fields.

### Thorn:
Since I’m new to network analysis, I find it a bit overwhelming to learn everything quickly. There’s a lot to take in, and I feel like I need to get up to speed fast to apply it to our research. I’m trying to work through it step by step, but it’s definitely one of the more challenging aspects of the project right now.

## Additional thought
There’s a conference coming up, and my professor is thinking about submitting this project as a paper. Working on this for a potential submission would be a great opportunity, so I want to focus on making sure our research is solid and well-documented.
