## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date:
04-06-2025


### Number of hours:
4 -5 hours for proposal drafting
1-2 hours meetings withprofessor
3-4 hours for data cleaning
2=3 hours for data analysis

### Rose:
This week, the big win was finishing the proposal and completing the data collection and cleaning. I also did some basic analysis to start getting a clearer picture of the patterns. It feels really good to see everything moving forward and starting to come together—this project is definitely feeling more real now. I’m also really pleased with how the proposal turned out; it feels solid and in line with what I want to achieve.

### Bud:
I’m looking forward to digging into the more complex data analysis next, especially figuring out the clustering of software adoption. It’ll be interesting to explore the relationships between geographic, linguistic, and academic lineage factors. I also want to start visualizing these patterns, which should help explain some of the trends I’m seeing.


### Thorn:
I’ve encountered a few issues with interpreting the initial analysis. Some patterns in the data aren’t as clear as I hoped, and I’m not sure if it’s due to the cleaning process or something missing in the data itself. I need to dive deeper into the methods to figure out how to clarify the results.

## Additional thought
