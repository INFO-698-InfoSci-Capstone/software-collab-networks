# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date:
Week 31 March - 5th April

log date 04/04/2025


### Number of hours:


- 2 h/week: Update LinkedIn, refine my resume, complete D2L videos, and work on professional-skills development
- 3 h/week – Calculate data‐loss metrics: count and compute percentages of missing author country codes and missing DOIs at each merge and OpenAlex lookup.
- 2 h/week – Enrich the merged dataset by adding software names, publication years, and DOIs.
- 4 h/week – Run and troubleshoot the R author_edgelist script to generate the DOI–author edgelist CSV.
- 2 h/week – Work through the igraph tutorials on our project wiki to get comfortable with network representation and visualization.



### Rose:
I’ve sketched out a clear workflow to measure data loss at each stage, enrich our dataset with software names, publication years, and DOIs, and build an author–DOI edgelist for network analysis.

### Bud:
I’m excited to see how missing affiliations, DOIs, and software mentions reveal patterns in scientific tool adoption once we visualize the network.

### Thorn:
Navigating the multi-stage merging process and configuring the R author_edgelist script has proven challenging, so I’m methodically working through each step to ensure accuracy and maintain momentum.
