## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date:
Week April 7th - 12th APril

log date 04/11/2025


### Number of hours:


- 3 h – Clean and harmonize the dataset so it’s accurate, consistent, and aligned with our initial files.
- 4 h – Perform the language analysis (frequency counts, yearly trends, and language–software correlations).
- 3 h – Run chi-square and ANOVA tests on the language versus software usage data.
- 2 h – Document data loss at each merge/OpenAlex step (both counts and percentages).
- 1 h – Compile an Excel file with DOI, language, software, and year columns.
- 1 h – Upload all dat



### Rose:
I’ve cleaned and reconciled the dataset, ensuring every record matches our original sources and catching inconsistencies early.

### Bud:
I’m eager to dive into the language analysis—mapping out the most-used languages, tracking trends by year, and correlating them with software mentions.

### Thorn:
Pausing the network analysis until we get the professor’s specific instructions feels a bit stalled, but it’s forcing me to nail down these preliminary steps perfectly.
