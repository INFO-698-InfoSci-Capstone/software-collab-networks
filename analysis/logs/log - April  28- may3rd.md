# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date:
Week April 28th - May3rd

log date 05/02/2025


### Number of hours:


- 3 h – Refine the author collaboration network: map edge widths to joint paper counts and scale nodes by each author’s total collaborations.
- 2 h – Construct the software–author bipartite graph: size software nodes prominently and render author nodes proportionally smaller.
- 3 h – Design language–software comparison visuals (bar charts and heatmaps) with clear axes, color scales, and annotations.
- 2 h – Polish all figures: optimize layouts, typography, and color consistency for clarity and presentation readiness.



### Rose:
Adjusting node sizes by author activity and edge thickness by collaboration frequency will immediately spotlight our most valuable partnerships and busiest contributors.

### Bud:
Creating a software-centric bipartite diagram—where each major tool is a prominent hub linked to its users—will clearly reveal adoption patterns at a glance

### Thorn:
Calibrating multiple visual dimensions (edge weight, node size, color) without overcrowding the display demands precise tuning and iterative refinement.
